// Integration tests currently disabled - using simplified database-only tests instead
// This file would contain complex integration tests that require the full application context
// For now, we're using simplified tests in simple_*.rs files that work independently

// TODO: Implement full integration tests once the application architecture supports it
// These tests would include:
// - Full API endpoint testing
// - Multi-layer integration (routes -> services -> repositories)
// - File upload testing
// - Concurrent booking conflict testing
// - Error handling across all layers

// For now, use:
// - simple_basic_tests.rs for database connectivity
// - simple_calendar_tests.rs for calendar operations
// - simple_booking_tests.rs for booking operations

#[cfg(test)]
mod disabled_integration_tests {
    // Tests would go here when application context is available

    #[test]
    fn placeholder_test() {
        // This ensures the file compiles but does nothing
        assert!(true);
    }
}
